# GFRP RC Beam Simulation

This repository contains a simple Python-based model to simulate the nonlinear load–deflection behavior of FRP-strengthened RC beams.

### 🧱 About
This example demonstrates the effect of FRP on stiffness and deflection using a basic numerical model.  
It’s a starting point for my future work combining **AI and Digital Modeling** for FRP-based structural systems.
